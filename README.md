# Flight Booking Frontend

This repository contains the frontend for a flight booking application. The backend can be found [here](https://github.com/tanishabisht/Fullstack-FlightBookingBackend). The application is built using React JS, with state management via React Hooks, and styled entirely with SCSS.

## Intructions to run the application

1. Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
   - Node version: v16.20.2
   - `nvm install v16.20.2`
   - `nvm use v16.20.2`
2. Clone the repository and open it in your preferred development environment (e.g., VS Code).
3. Open the terminal in your editor and run:
   - `npm install` to install all the node packages and dependencies from [`package.json`](/package.json).
   - `npm start` to start the server.
